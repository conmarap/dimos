# Node

In this folder you'll find the code that any node would run. Essentially, this is a server that accepts end-to-end encrypted connections from peers for handling transactions or updates. At the same time, nodes will need to keep track of the state of the network by repeating the messages that they receive to any other node they are aware of on the network. The most crucial functionality is how blocks are created and propagated throughout the network.
